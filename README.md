### Plataform 

Web3 learning platform 


### Requirements

### Environment 
- Copy the contents in `.env.example` to `.env` 
- Set the Firebase and the Discord variables
- Set all the other necessary variables

### Loading Firebase contents on your project

You must have an active google cloud account. Maybe you will have to activate the billing to make it work.
- Install [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)
- Install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud)
- run `gcloud config set project <YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT>`
- run `./load_db.sh`

```
git clone https://github.com/w3b3d3v/web3-bootcamp-platform.git web3-bootcamp-plataform

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Now, the plataform is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `build` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.
