# Story SEO-001.5: FAQ Page Implementation (Optional - High Impact)

**Epic:** SEO-001 - SEO & AEO Enhancement
**Story ID:** SEO-001.5
**Priority:** Medium (High Impact if implemented)
**Estimated Effort:** 1 day
**Status:** Done

---

## User Story

**As a** prospective student or AI assistant
**I want** a comprehensive FAQ page with structured data
**So that** I can quickly find answers to common questions about the bootcamp

---

## Background

**Why FAQ is Important for AEO:**
- ✅ Direct source for AI assistants to answer user questions
- ✅ Targets conversational search queries ("What is...", "How do I...")
- ✅ Featured snippets in Google Search ("People Also Ask")
- ✅ Improves organic traffic for long-tail keywords
- ✅ Reduces support burden by answering common questions

**Current State:**
- ❌ No dedicated FAQ page exists
- ❌ No FAQPage schema implemented
- ❌ Common questions scattered across docs

**This Story:**
- Create standalone FAQ page at `/faq`
- Implement FAQPage schema (JSON-LD)
- Optimize Q&A for AI extraction (150-300 words per answer)
- Source questions from user queries, support tickets, Discord

---

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Create FAQ Page (`pages/faq.js`)

```jsx
import SEOHead from '../components/SEO';
import { buildFAQSchema, buildBreadcrumbSchema } from '../components/SEO/schemas';
import { faqData } from '../data/faq';

export default function FAQPage() {
  // Build schemas
  const faqSchema = buildFAQSchema(faqData);
  const breadcrumbSchema = buildBreadcrumbSchema([
    { name: 'Home', url: 'https://build.w3d.community' },
    { name: 'FAQ', url: 'https://build.w3d.community/faq' },
  ]);

  return (
    <>
      <SEOHead
        title="Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"
        description="Find answers to common questions about WEB3DEV bootcamp. Learn about courses, NFT certificates, enrollment, Discord support, and getting started with Web3."
        canonical="/faq"
        keywords={[
          'web3dev faq', 'bootcamp questions', 'web3 bootcamp help',
          'NFT certificate questions', 'how to start web3'
        ]}
        jsonLd={[faqSchema, breadcrumbSchema]}
      />

      <div className="faq-page">
        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p className="intro">
          Find answers to common questions about WEB3DEV bootcamp. Can't find what you're looking for? Join our <a href="https://discord.w3d.community">Discord community</a>.
        </p>

        {faqData.map((section, idx) => (
          <section key={idx} className="faq-section">
            <h2>{section.category}</h2>
            {section.questions.map((faq, qIdx) => (
              <div key={qIdx} className="faq-item" itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Question">
                <h3 itemProp="name">{faq.question}</h3>
                <div itemProp="acceptedAnswer" itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer">
                  <div itemProp="text" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: faq.answer }} />
                </div>
              </div>
            ))}
          </section>
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 2. FAQ Data Structure (`data/faq.js`)

```javascript
export const faqData = [
  {
    category: "Getting Started",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What is WEB3DEV Bootcamp?",
        answer: `WEB3DEV Bootcamp is a free online learning platform focused on blockchain and Web3 education. We offer hands-on courses in smart contract development, DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 technologies. Upon completion, students receive NFT-based certificates stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Our courses are primarily in Portuguese with growing English content, and we provide Discord community support throughout your learning journey.`
      },
      {
        question: "How much does it cost to join the bootcamp?",
        answer: `WEB3DEV Bootcamp is completely free. There are no hidden fees, subscriptions, or charges. All courses, materials, Discord support, and NFT certificates are provided at no cost. Our mission is to make Web3 education accessible to everyone, regardless of financial background.`
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need prior programming experience?",
        answer: `It depends on the course. Our beginner courses assume no prior blockchain knowledge and only basic programming familiarity. Intermediate courses may require JavaScript or similar programming experience. Each course page clearly states the prerequisites and recommended skill level. If you're completely new to programming, we recommend starting with our blockchain fundamentals course before moving to smart contract development.`
      },
      {
        question: "How do I enroll in a course?",
        answer: `Enrolling is simple: First, sign in to the platform using your Google or GitHub account. Browse the course catalog at build.w3d.community/courses and select a course. Click "Enroll" or "Start Course" to begin. You'll be asked to connect your MetaMask wallet (for NFT certificates) and optionally your Discord account (for community support). Once enrolled, you can start learning immediately at your own pace.`
      },
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "NFT Certificates",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What are NFT certificates?",
        answer: `NFT certificates are blockchain-based completion certificates stored on the Ethereum network. Unlike traditional certificates that can be lost or forged, NFT certificates are permanently stored on-chain and verifiable by anyone. Each certificate is a unique, non-transferable NFT that proves you completed a specific WEB3DEV bootcamp course. You can display your NFT certificates on professional networks like LinkedIn, and potential employers can verify their authenticity on the blockchain.`
      },
      {
        question: "How do I receive my NFT certificate?",
        answer: `You'll receive your NFT certificate automatically after completing all course requirements: finishing all 5 course sections, submitting required code projects, and passing any quizzes. Once you complete the final section, the platform will prompt you to claim your NFT. Make sure your MetaMask wallet is connected. The NFT will be minted directly to your Ethereum address within a few minutes. You'll see it in your profile and can view it on OpenSea at opensea.io/collection/web3dev-bootcamp.`
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need ETH or cryptocurrency to receive my certificate?",
        answer: `No, you do not need any ETH or cryptocurrency. WEB3DEV covers all gas fees for minting NFT certificates. You only need a MetaMask wallet address to receive the NFT. Creating a MetaMask wallet is free, and you don't need to purchase any cryptocurrency. We handle all blockchain transaction costs so certificates remain completely free for students.`
      },
      {
        question: "Can I transfer my NFT certificate to another wallet?",
        answer: `No, NFT certificates are non-transferable (soulbound). This design prevents fraud and ensures the certificate genuinely represents your achievement. The certificate is permanently linked to the wallet address you used when completing the course. If you need to prove ownership from a different address, you can sign a message with your original wallet. This non-transferable design is a security feature that makes our certificates more valuable and trustworthy to employers.`
      },
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Learning Experience",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How long does it take to complete a course?",
        answer: `Course duration varies by content and your learning pace. Most courses are designed to be completed in 7-10 days with 1-2 hours of daily study. However, all courses are self-paced, so you can take as long as you need. We offer both "Eternal" cohorts (no deadline, start anytime) and event-based cohorts with scheduled live sessions and fixed timelines. The course page shows estimated completion time, and your profile tracks your progress across all enrolled courses.`
      },
      {
        question: "What is a cohort?",
        answer: `A cohort is a group of students who start a course together. We offer two cohort types: "Eternal" cohorts are always open and self-paced with no deadlines, perfect for learning at your own schedule. Event-based cohorts have specific start/end dates, include live coding sessions, and provide a more structured learning experience with peer collaboration. Cohort information is included in your NFT certificate metadata. Both cohort types receive the same high-quality content and Discord support.`
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a Discord community for support?",
        answer: `Yes! Our Discord community is a core part of the learning experience. Each course has dedicated channels mirroring the 5-section course structure, plus channels for sharing progress and getting help. Connect your Discord account when enrolling to automatically join course-specific channels. The community includes students, mentors, and WEB3DEV team members. We host weekly office hours, live coding sessions, and group discussions. Join at discord.w3d.community.`
      },
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Technical Requirements",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What do I need to get started?",
        answer: `You need: (1) A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge), (2) A Google or GitHub account for signing in, (3) MetaMask wallet browser extension for receiving NFT certificates (free to install from metamask.io), and (4) Optional but recommended: Discord account for community support. No blockchain experience required to start, and we'll guide you through MetaMask setup in your first course.`
      },
      {
        question: "Which programming languages will I learn?",
        answer: `Our courses cover multiple languages depending on the subject: Solidity for smart contract development, JavaScript and TypeScript for Web3 frontend and dApp development, and general blockchain concepts. Most courses include hands-on coding with real development tools. We provide code templates, examples, and a built-in code submission system. Each course page lists the specific technologies and languages covered.`
      },
      {
        question: "Can I access courses on mobile devices?",
        answer: `Yes, our platform is mobile-responsive and works on tablets and smartphones. However, for the best learning experience with code examples and hands-on projects, we recommend using a desktop or laptop computer. Mobile devices are great for reading lessons and watching videos, but coding exercises are easier on larger screens with keyboards. Your progress syncs across all devices, so you can read on mobile and code on desktop.`
      },
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "After Completion",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Can I become a mentor after completing courses?",
        answer: `Yes! Graduates are encouraged to become mentors and help new students. Mentorship is a great way to reinforce your learning, build teaching skills, and contribute to the Web3 community. To become a mentor, complete at least one course with high marks, stay active in Discord, and demonstrate strong understanding of the material. Mentors receive special Discord roles, recognition in the community, and may receive additional perks. Contact us in Discord to express your interest in mentoring.`
      },
      {
        question: "How can I showcase my NFT certificate on LinkedIn?",
        answer: `LinkedIn supports adding NFT certificates to your profile in the "Licenses & Certifications" section. Add a new certification with: Name: "[Course Name] - WEB3DEV Bootcamp", Issuing Organization: "WEB3DEV", Issue Date: [Completion date], Credential ID: [Your NFT token ID], Credential URL: [OpenSea or Etherscan link to your NFT]. You can also screenshot your certificate and add it as media. This makes your blockchain credentials visible to recruiters and validates your Web3 skills.`
      },
    ]
  },
];
```

### 3. FAQ Schema Builder (Already created in SEO-001.1)

Verify `components/SEO/schemas.js` includes:

```javascript
export function buildFAQSchema(faqData) {
  // Flatten all questions from all categories
  const allQuestions = faqData.flatMap(section =>
    section.questions.map(faq => ({
      question: faq.question,
      answer: faq.answer.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, ''), // Strip HTML tags for schema
    }))
  );

  return {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'FAQPage',
    mainEntity: allQuestions.map(faq => ({
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: faq.question,
      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: faq.answer,
      },
    })),
  };
}
```

---

### 4. Add FAQ Link to Navigation

Update site navigation to include FAQ link:

```jsx
// components/Navbar (or wherever navigation is defined)
<nav>
  <Link href="/">Home</Link>
  <Link href="/courses">Courses</Link>
  <Link href="/faq">FAQ</Link>
  {/* Other links */}
</nav>
```

---
