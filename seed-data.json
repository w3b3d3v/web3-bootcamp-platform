      "body": "#### Description:\nWith the recent update to source course metadata from language-specific metadata fields, there are multiple instances in our codebase where this retrieval logic is repeated. This redundancy can lead to maintenance challenges and potential bugs. We need to refactor the code to use a dynamic utility function that centralizes this logic and retrieves all available fields.\n\n#### Tasks:\n1. **Create a Dynamic Utility Function**:\n   - Develop a utility function that dynamically retrieves all metadata fields from `course.metadata` based on the specified language.\n   - The function should fall back to the root object fields if the metadata fields are not available.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const getCourseMetadata = (course, language) => {\n     const metadata = course?.metadata?.[language] || {};\n     const rootFields = course || {};\n     \n     // Combine metadata and root fields, giving priority to metadata\n     return Object.keys(rootFields).reduce((fields, key) => {\n       fields[key] = metadata[key] || rootFields[key];\n       return fields;\n     }, {});\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. **Refactor Existing Code**:\n   - Identify all instances in the codebase where metadata fields are being fetched from `course.metadata`.\n   - Replace these instances with calls to the new utility function.\n\n   Example refactor:\n   ```javascript\n   const courseMetadata = getCourseMetadata(course, language);\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Components and Functions**:\n   - Ensure that all components and functions that rely on these fields use the utility function to fetch the metadata.\n\n4. **Test the Refactor**:\n   - Test thoroughly to ensure that the utility function works correctly across different parts of the application.\n   - Validate that features depending on these metadata fields are functioning correctly.",

This approach limits our flexibility and adds a heavy dependency on MetaMask and ThirdWeb.\n\nWe should replace MetaMask with WalletConnect directly, which will enable us to support a wider range of wallets, including those in ecosystems like Solana and Polkadot.

For example:\n   - If my GitHub email is `yan@nomadbitcoin.xyz` and my login email on the platform is `yan@teste.com`, after connecting GitHub, my session changes to `yan@nomadbitcoin.xyz`.\n- **Expected Behavior:** The session should remain associated with the original platform login (`yan@teste.com`) and should not switch to the GitHub email.\n- **Root Cause:** The current implementation uses `loginGithub`, which initiates a login instead of simply connecting GitHub. It should be refactored to avoid altering the session.",
